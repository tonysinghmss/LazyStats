# LazyStats
LazyStats is a dummy android application.
I am exploring Android programming.
This is a simple application where you can create a personal statistical log
and then log your data.

Till now I have implemented creation and visualization of the list of statistics.
Lots of things are pending and need to be done. I will update it as and when I find time.

Below is the list of components I have used till now in this app:
<ul>
<li>Navigation Drawer Activity along with Fragments.</li>
<li>LoaderManager callbacks with CursorLoader.</li>
<li>RecyclerView Adapter.</li>
<li>Content Provider.</li>
<li>GraphView</li>
</ul>
